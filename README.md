## Tech Stack üíª

Our application relies on a robust tech stack, carefully chosen to ensure high performance and user satisfaction. Here's an overview of the key technologies:

- **Voy as the Vector Store**: We utilize Voy for storing and managing vectors. This technology is fully WebAssembly (WASM) compatible, ensuring seamless execution in the browser. This contributes to a faster and more responsive experience for users.

- **Ollama for Local LLM**: Ollama is responsible for running a Language Model Locally (LLM) and exposing it to the web app. This approach enhances the security and reliability of our application, allowing for real-time interaction with PDF documents.

- **LangChain.js for Orchestration**: LangChain.js is the backbone of our application, orchestrating all the pieces seamlessly. It helps in calling the models, performing retrieval, and ensuring smooth operation. Its architecture is designed for efficiency and user-friendliness.

- **Transformers.js for Embeddings**: Transformers.js is a critical component responsible for running embeddings in the browser. This technology ensures that PDF documents are processed with high accuracy and efficiency.

## How to Run and Use PDF-pedia üöÄ

Running and using PDF-pedia is a straightforward process. It's a Next.js app that allows you to extract content from uploaded PDFs, store it, and perform Rapid Answer Generation (RAG), all on the client side. Plus, you can even go offline after the site loads! Here's a step-by-step guide to get started:

To run/deploy this yourself, simply fork this repo and install the required dependencies with `yarn`.

There are no required environment variables!

1. **Explore the Live Version**:
   You can experience PDF-pedia right away by visiting the live version at [PDF-pedia Live Demo](Insert demo link). This gives you a quick overview of what the project can do.

2. **Download and Set Up Ollama**:
   To harness the full power of PDF-pedia, you'll need to download and set up Ollama. Ollama allows the web app to access a locally running Mistral instance. Follow these steps:

   - Download Ollama from the official repository.
   - Install and configure Ollama on your system as per the provided instructions.

3. **Allow Site Access to Ollama**:
   To enable PDF-pedia to communicate with Ollama, you need to set a few environment variables. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   $OLLAMA_ORIGINS=https"Deployment_Link" OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11435 ollama serve

4. **Pull Mistral Instance**:
In a separate terminal window, run the following command to connect PDF-pedia to the locally running Mistral instance:

   ```bash
   $ OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11435 ollama pull mistral
